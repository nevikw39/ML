However, if you use the softmax and the cross entropy loss, that complexity fades away. Since the softmax layer is usually used at the output, we can actually calculate the derivative of the categorical cross-entropy loss with respect to the n-th node in the last hidden layer. Instead of a long clunky formula, you end up with this terse, easy to compute thing: $$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial Z_i} = s_i - y_i $$, where $s$ is the output of the softmax function and the $y$ is the true label vector(one-hot vector).

For this assignment, in the binary classification, you will use the former approach which is the more common practice, and the latter approach with focal loss (not CCE), due to its ease of implementation.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6yVQQqe2EyHA"},"source":["A_prev, W, b = np.array([[0.1, 1.1, 2.9],[-1.2, 0.2, -2.5],[1.9, 2.3, 3.7]]), np.array([[0.1], [0.2], [0.3]]), np.array([[-0.5]])\n","model = Model([3, 1], [\"sigmoid\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","print(\"With sigmoid: A = \" + str(A))\n","A_prev, W, b = np.array([[4.35, -5.67], [-7.89, 8.12]]), np.array([[-3.54], [-2.34]]), np.array([[0.8]])\n","model = Model([2, 1], [\"sigmoid\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","outputs[\"model_forward_sigmoid\"] = (A, (model.linear[0].cache, model.activation[0].cache))\n","\n","A_prev, W, b = np.array([[0.1, 1.1, 2.9],[-1.2, 0.2, -2.5],[1.9, 2.3, 3.7]]), np.array([[0.1], [0.2], [0.3]]), np.array([[-0.5]])\n","model = Model([3, 1], [\"relu\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","print(\"With ReLU: A = \" + str(A))\n","A_prev, W, b = np.array([[7.23, -4.56], [5.67, -8.90]]), np.array([[-9.12], [3.45]]), np.array([[0.25]])\n","model = Model([2, 1], [\"relu\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","outputs[\"model_forward_relu\"] = (A, (model.linear[0].cache, model.activation[0].cache))\n","\n","A_prev, W, b = np.array([[0.1, 1.1, 2.9],[-1.2, 0.2, -2.5],[1.9, 2.3, 3.7]]), np.array([[0.1, -0.1, -0.1],[0.2, -0.2, 0.],[0.3, -0.3, 0.1]]), np.array([[-0.5, 0.5, 0.1]])\n","model = Model([3, 3], [\"softmax\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","print(\"With softmax: A = \\n\" + str(A))\n","A_prev, W, b = np.array([[-5.12, 4.56, 7.89], [8.34, -6.78, 2.45], [3.21, -4.67, 5.98]]), np.array([[6.23, -7.85, 4.56], [-3.21, 9.87, -2.34], [1.23, -5.67, 8.90]]), np.array([[4.12, -6.54, 7.89]])\n","model = Model([3, 3], [\"softmax\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","outputs[\"model_forward_softmax\"] = (A, (model.linear[0].cache, model.activation[0].cache))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QMkf2ss6F52W"},"source":["Expected output:\n","<table>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>With Sigmoid:</td>\n","    <td>A = [[0.64565631] [0.20915937] [0.77902611]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>With ReLU:</td>\n","    <td>A = [[0.6 ] [0. ] [1.26]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>With Softmax:</td>\n","    <td>A = [[0.47535001 0.14317267 0.38147732] [0.05272708 0.75380161 0.19347131] [0.68692136 0.05526942 0.25780921]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","</table>"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"s26LVkCbIbJ3"},"source":["# binary classification\n","X = np.array([[0, -2, 0.5], [1, -1, 0.5], [2, 0, 0.5]])\n","model = Model([3, 3, 1], [\"relu\", \"sigmoid\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","AL = model.forward(X)\n","print(\"AL = \" + str(AL))\n","print(\"Length of layers list = \" + str(len(model.linear)))\n","\n","# multi-class classification\n","X = np.array([[0, -2, 0.5], [1, -1, 0.5], [2, 0, 0.5]])\n","model = Model([3, 3, 10], [\"relu\", \"softmax\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","AL = model.forward(X)\n","print(\"AL = \" + str(AL))\n","print(\"Length of layers list = \" + str(len(model.linear)))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zoCdrONOHhvw"},"source":["Expected output:\n","<table>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>AL:</td>\n","    <td>[[0.56058713] [0.55220559] [0.46331713]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>Length of layers list:</td>\n","    <td>2</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>AL:</td>\n","    <td>[[0.11637212 0.08186754 0.0924809  0.09675205 0.12819411 0.09664001 0.08448599 0.09067641 0.1294968  0.08303407]\n","         [0.11413265 0.08432761 0.09365443 0.09736489 0.12404237 0.09726785 0.08664355 0.09207969 0.12512634 0.08536063]\n","         [0.09750771 0.07419482 0.08444682 0.10943351 0.09669465 0.11116299 0.08734059 0.12452515 0.13002144 0.08467232]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>Length of layers list:</td>\n","    <td>2</td>\n","  </tr>\n","</table>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hPBl7iq7N2wY"},"source":["###3.3.3.

You can adjust $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ based on the data distribution shown in the plot below.\n","\n","**Note**: When spliting data, you could try to plot and see if the data distribution is the same in training and validation to ensure the the correctness of your validation."],"metadata":{"id":"vAvUwG1uSLg_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"Cu8T1DKjb7Bn"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# load data\n","data = np.load('/content/drive/MyDrive/basic_data.npz')\n","X_train, Y_train = data[\"x_train\"], data[\"y_train\"]\n","X_test = data[\"x_test\"]\n","\n","# plot the data distribution\n","Y_train_1 = len(['_' for y in Y_train if y == 1])\n","Y_train_0 = len(['_' for y in Y_train if y == 0])\n","plt.figure(figsize=(2, 2))\n","plt.bar([0, 1], [Y_train_0, Y_train_1])\n","plt.title('Data distribution')\n","plt.xlabel('label')\n","plt.ylabel('counts')\n","plt.show()\n","\n","print('Train: x=%s, y=%s' % (X_train.shape, Y_train.shape))\n","print('Test: x=%s' % (X_test.shape, ))\n","\n","### START CODE HERE ###\n","# train_val split\n","n = X_train.shape[0]\n","x_train, y_train = None, None\n","x_val, y_val = None, None\n","### END CODE HERE ###\n","\n","print(\"x_train: \" + str(x_train.shape) + \" | y_train: \" + str(y_train.shape))\n","print(\"x_val: \" + str(x_val.shape) + \" | y_val: \" + str(y_val.shape))"],"metadata":{"id":"pQ0xMNj7b-1q"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Training and Evaluation"],"metadata":{"id":"r01QzzHxeMbR"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fI7JY5ESjhZ2"},"source":["# GRADED CODE: binary classification\n","### START CODE HERE ###\n","\n","loss_function = None\n","if loss_function == 'cross_entropy':\n","    layers_dims = None\n","    activation_fn = None\n","    gamma = None        # you can leave this as it is\n","    alpha = None        # you can leave this as it is\n","    y_train_processed = None\n","    y_val_processed = None\n","    assert y_train_processed.shape[-1] == 1, \"see the 'Note' in the Basic implementation section\"\n","    assert y_val_processed.shape[-1] == 1, \"see the 'Note' in the Basic implementation section\"\n","elif loss_function == 'focal_loss':\n","    layers_dims = None\n","    activation_fn = None\n","    gamma = None\n","    alpha = None\n","    y_train_processed = None\n","    y_val_processed = None\n","    assert y_train_processed.shape[-1] == 2, \"see the 'Note' in the Basic implementation section\"\n","    assert y_val_processed.shape[-1] == 2, \"see the 'Note' in the Basic implementation section\"\n","\n","learning_rate = None\n","num_iterations = None\n","print_loss = True\n","print_freq = 1000\n","classes = 2\n","losses = []                         # keep track of loss\n","model = Model(layers_dims, activation_fn, loss_function, alpha, gamma)\n","\n","# Loop (batch gradient descent)\n","for i in range(0, num_iterations):\n","    # forward\n","    AL = None\n","\n","    # compute loss\n","    if loss_function == 'cross_entropy':\n","        loss = None\n","    elif loss_function == 'focal_loss':\n","        loss =  None\n","\n","    # backward\n","    dA_prev = None\n","\n","    # update\n","    None\n","\n","    losses.append(loss)\n","    if print_loss and i % print_freq == 0:\n","        print (\"Loss after iteration %i: %f\" %(i, loss))\n","\n","# plot the loss\n","plt.figure(figsize=(6, 3))\n","plt.plot(np.squeeze(losses))\n","plt.ylabel('loss')\n","plt.xlabel(f'iterations (per {print_freq})')\n","plt.title(\"Learning rate =\" + str(learning_rate))\n","plt.show()\n","### END CODE HERE ###"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print('training------')\n","pred_train = predict(x_train, y_train_processed, model)\n","print('validation------')\n","pred_val = predict(x_val, y_val_processed, model)"],"metadata":{"id":"U8q0a20XcPtk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mERo3g41zsyX"},"source":["pred_test = predict(X_test, None, model)\n","outputs[\"basic_pred_test\"] = pred_test\n","outputs[\"basic_layers_dims\"] = layers_dims\n","outputs[\"basic_activation_fn\"] = activation_fn\n","outputs[\"basic_loss_function\"] = loss_function\n","outputs[\"basic_alpha\"] = alpha\n","outputs[\"basic_gamma\"] = gamma\n","basic_model_parameters = []\n","for basic_linear in model.linear:\n","    basic_model_parameters.append(basic_linear.parameters)\n","outputs[\"basic_model_parameters\"] = basic_model_parameters"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oMCpPFMVdj36"},"source":["# Advanced implementation (multi class classification) (15%)\n","\n","In this section, you need to implement a multi-class classifier using the functions you had previously written.
